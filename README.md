### Project title
Udacity Python course

### Project description
The aim of this project was to learn Python and its data analysis tools (namely NumPy and Pandas). Three datasets were provided by Udacity as .csv files, each one holding data from a bike sharing platform for a city over a six month period.

My task was to write a script that would enable user interaction with the data to provide valuable insights. User can choose a city, filter by month or day and then view the calculated statistical information based on those parameters.

### Files used
chicago.csv
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv

### Credits
Credits go to Udacity nanodegree for learning materials, and providing assistance with the structure of the code:
